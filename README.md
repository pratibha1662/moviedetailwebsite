# Movie Details Website

[Project Link](https://pratibha1662.github.io/moviedetailwebsite/)

A single-page web application designed to let users search for movies and web series with ease. Built with a clean and responsive UI, the platform fetches detailed information about titles including ratings, genre, cast, plot, and more â€” all powered by the OMDB API.

## Why I Built This

I built this project to enhance my front-end development skills and explore working with third-party APIs. The goal was to create a visually appealing and functional platform where users can quickly find information about their favorite movies and shows. It was also a great opportunity to practice clean UI/UX design, improve API handling, and build a real-world application using JavaScript.

## This website application provides the following functionality:

- Allows users to search for movies and web series using a central keyword-based search box.
- Fetches and displays detailed information including title, release year, genre, plot, rating, and cast.
- Utilizes the OMDB API to retrieve real-time movie data.
- Presents search results in a clean and user-friendly layout.
- Includes smooth, minimalist animations to enhance the overall browsing experience.
- Offers a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Acts as a lightweight alternative for quickly looking up entertainment info without ads or clutter.
- Can be used as a reference tool for movie lovers, students, or content creators needing quick access to film data.
